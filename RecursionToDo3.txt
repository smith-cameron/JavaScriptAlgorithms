To Do 3
Recursive Binary Search
Given a sorted array and a value, recursively determine whether value is found within array.

rBinarySearch([1,3,5,6],4) = false;

rBinarySearch([4,5,6,8,12],5) = true.



Greatest Common Factor
Given two integers, create rGCF(num1,num2) to recursively determine Greatest Common Factor (the largest integer dividing evenly into both). Greek mathematician Euclid demonstrated these facts:

gcf(a,b) == a, if a == b;
gcf(a,b) == gcf(a-b,b), if a>b;
gcf(a,b) == gcf(a,b-a), if b>a.
Second: rework facts #2 and #3 to reduce stack consumption and expand rGCF’s reach. You should  be able to compute rGCF(123456,987654).



Bonus Challenges (Optional)
Tarai
The Tarai (Japanese: “to pass around”) function was created to profile recursive performance in various systems and languages. Unlike other functions, numbers don't get particularly large, but the amount of recursion is significant. The tarai function accepts three parameters and is defined as:

tarai(x,y,z) == y, if x <= y (otherwise see rule #2);
tarai(x,y,z) == tarai(tarai(x-1,y,z),tarai(y-1,z,x),tarai(z-1,x,y)).
Calling tarai(10,2,9) should return 9 (after recursing 4145 times!).

String: In-Order Subsets
Create strSubsets(str). Return an array with every possible in-order character subset of str. The resultant array itself need not be in any specific order – it is the subset of letters in each string that must be in the same order as they were in the original string. Given "abc", return an array that includes ["", "c", "b", "bc", "a", "ac", "ab", "abc"] (in any order).
